# CryptoBase

## Introduction

CryptoBase is designed to be a ready-to-deploy all inclusive information dominance system for the blockchain industry. It contains an ever-increasing series of lightweight shell scripts that will instantly begin collecting publicly available social and economic intelligence which can then be analyzed in whatever manner one sees appropriate. Analysis mechanisms are not included in this project. 

## Deployment

All shell scripts included in this project can be deployed from any common Linux distribution. In most cases a system administrator must first enable the scripts to be executable in the following way:

Assuming the target script is called "example.sh", the authorization of this script would be:
```
sudo chmod +x example.sh
```
If you are attempting to authorize all scripts in a specific directory "example-directory", then use a wildcard in the command like this: 
```
cd example-directory && sudo chmod +x *
```
## Additional Notes

All front end code can be found inside the 'docs' folder. The rest of the directories are dedicated to the various processes and functions of the back end.
